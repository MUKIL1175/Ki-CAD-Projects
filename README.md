PCB Designs Repository
Welcome to my PCB designs repository! This repository contains a collection of various PCB (Printed Circuit Board) designs created using KiCad, a powerful and open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool. The designs cover a wide range of applications and are available for download or reference. Feel free to explore and contribute.

Repository Overview
This repository hosts PCB designs that can be used for a variety of electronic projects. Each design is organized in individual folders with detailed files and documentation. These designs are intended to be open-source and are available for educational, personal, and professional use.

Key Features:
KiCad Project Files: Complete project files for each PCB design.
Schematic Diagrams: Clear and easy-to-understand circuit schematics.
Gerber Files: Ready-to-manufacture Gerber files for PCB fabrication.
BOM (Bill of Materials): A list of components needed for the design, including suppliers.
How to Use the Designs
Download the Project Files: Navigate to the specific project folder and download the KiCad project files.
Open in KiCad: Use KiCad to open the .pro file to access the full project, including the schematic and PCB layout.
Generate Gerber Files: You can generate Gerber files from the KiCad project using the "Plot" option in KiCad, suitable for PCB manufacturing.
Modify and Customize: Feel free to modify these designs as per your project requirements. Always ensure the component specifications and footprints are compatible with your needs.
