# PCB Designs Repository

Welcome to my **PCB Designs Repository**! This repository contains a collection of various **PCB (Printed Circuit Board)** designs created using **KiCad**, a powerful and open-source **EDA (Electronic Design Automation)** tool. The designs span a wide range of applications and are available for download or reference. Feel free to explore, download, and contribute!

## Repository Overview

This repository hosts **PCB designs** suitable for a variety of electronic projects. Each design is organized into individual folders, which contain detailed files and documentation. These designs are open-source and can be used for educational, personal, and professional purposes.

## Key Features

- **KiCad Project Files**: Complete project files for each PCB design.
- **Schematic Diagrams**: Clear and easy-to-understand circuit schematics.
- **Gerber Files**: Ready-to-manufacture Gerber files for PCB fabrication.

## How to Use the Designs

1. **Download the Project Files**:
   Navigate to the specific project folder and download the KiCad project files.

2. **Open in KiCad**:
   Use **KiCad** to open the `.pro` project file. This will provide access to the full project, including the schematic and PCB layout.

3. **Generate Gerber Files**:
   You can generate Gerber files from the KiCad project using the "Plot" option in KiCad, which will be suitable for PCB manufacturing.

4. **Modify and Customize**:
   Feel free to modify the designs as per your project requirements. Always verify that the component specifications and footprints are compatible with your needs.
